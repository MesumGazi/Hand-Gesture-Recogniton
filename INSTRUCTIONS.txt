Instructions:

Collecting Data:
Run the datacollection.py script to collect data.
Perform the hand gesture in front of the camera.
The script will capture and save photos in the respective folders (i.e., HELLO, GOODBYE, PEACE) inside the 'data' folder.

Training the Model:

Upload the 'data' folder to Google's Teachable Machine website.
Create a new image project, select 'Image Project', and import the 'data' folder.
Follow the instructions on the website to train the model and download the Keras model and 'labels.txt' file.
Save the Keras model and 'labels.txt' file inside the 'MODEL' folder.

Testing the Model:

Run the test.py script to open the camera and detect hand gestures.
Perform the hand gesture in front of the camera.
The script will recognize the hand gesture and display the predicted label.
Note: Make sure to have all necessary packages and libraries installed before running the scripts.
